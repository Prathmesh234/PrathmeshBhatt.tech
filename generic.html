								<h2>Research</h2>
								<p>
								Currently working as a research assistant under Dr Prakash along with another masters student in the Distributed Systems Lab . 
								The primary focus of the research is on increasing the efficiency of cache eviction as well as caching capacity without hindering 
								with the size of the cache . Implementing various algorithms using different voting techniques . Formulated a method of naru voting for tile eviction which ; increased the efficiency by 10 % in a month.
								Along with AI , research based on Oculus and developing 360 degrees video caching algorithm in order to efficiently display high quality video .

								Interned at NASA , Alabama in February 2021 . Part of the Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy . 
								Worked on several programming languages such as C# and C++ , however the primary focus was on C# 
								for Arduino programming . Final Project was to build a small scaled rocket with all the functionalites as the real one 
								example- motion tracking , projectile calculation , fuel burnout integeration  , atmosphere detection etc . Used Arduino as the hardware along with 
								SQL to store the data in the backend and node js as the server . Moreover , was interviewed by KFDM Fox News inlight to the  NASA internship.
